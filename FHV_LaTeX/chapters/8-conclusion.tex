explore the possibility of implementing different types of feedback (Explicit + Implicit -> Rating Matrix). \href{https://learnopencv.com/recommendation-system/}{Mastering Recommendation System: A Complete Guide}

Additionally, insights gained during the experimentation phase will be documented, particularly regarding the trade-offs between simplicity (single-input systems) and complexity (multi-input systems). These findings are anticipated to inform future research directions in \acs{AI} and fashion, particularly in areas such as recommendation systems, virtual styling assistants, and augmented reality try-ons.
